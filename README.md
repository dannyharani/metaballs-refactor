# About Metaballs
##### By: Hadi and Danny  

If you are interested in displaying your creativity in coding, there is no better code than "metaballs".
Metaballs shows beautiful organic shapes that can be represented in different ways with your creativity.
It is also a code that promotes critical thinking through resolving a complex question with a remarquably simple solution:
>How to visualise an isosurface (or a metaball) in 2D space?
>The distance formula can set the hue/colour of a pixel based on the number of shapes beside it.

### Here are a couple ideas of things that can be refactored:
* The _color mode_ to display the metaballs differently;
* The _sun_ can have a 'noisy' movement pattern;
* The _gravitational attraction_ can be modified to change movement speed;
* And **MUCH** more!

### Here are some things you learn in the process:
* How to _load pixels_ and update their colours;
* How to use _loops_ to repeat code efficiently;
* How to _calculate the distance_ between different vectors;
* How to _use vectors_ to simulate forces;
* How to _make an orbitting object_ with sin and cos;
* How to use _object oriented programing_ efficiently
* How to change the design of an _HTML_ page;
* And **MUCH** more!
